     * when using them. The algorithm used to compare the arrays does not check
     * all possible permutations, so it is possible that the matcher will match
     * a value that was provided verbatim later in the expected array.

     * **Using matchers with this validator is only recommended for advanced
     * users that know what they are doing!**

     * @example
     * ```ts
     * expect([1, 2, 3]).toEqualUnsorted([3, 1, 2])
     *
     * expect(['foo', 'bar']).not.toEqualUnsorted(['a', 'b', 'c'])
