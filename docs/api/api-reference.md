## API

### Validators

- `toEqual(object)` - performs deep equality check, ensures type equality, supports additional matchers. If no arg is
  provided it will be autofixed.
- `toLooseEqual(object)` - like toEqual but without type checking. If no arg is provided it will be autofixed.
- `toThrow(expected)` - checks if expected error was throws. It uses the same equality logic as toEqual. Use
  `expect.error()` matcher to quickly match errors. Requires checked value to be a parameterless function. If no arg is
  provided it will be autofixed.
- `toBeRejected(expected)` - checks if promise was rejected with a expected value. It uses the same equality logic as
  toEqual. Use `expect.error()` matcher to quickly match errors. Autofix currently not available. Note: this validator
  returns another promise that needs to be handled properly (awaited or returned from test case). To avoid mistakes use
  [`no-floating-promises`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-floating-promises.md)
  eslint rule (it's part of [TypeSTRICT](https://github.com/krzkaczor/typestrict)).
- `toBeExhausted()` - checks if given mock is exhausted. Works both with strict and loose mocks.

### Matchers

Matchers are used to match range of values. These should be combined with validators like `toEqual` or strictMocks's
`expectedCall`.

- `anything()` - matches anything
- `a(class)` - matches any instance of a class. Works as expected with primitives like String, Number etc. Use
  `a(Object)` to match any object (won't match null). Note: it doesn't work with TypeScript types because they are
  erased from the output - you need a JS class.
- `stringMatching(substring | regexp)` - matches any string containing given substring or matching given pattern
- `numberCloseTo(expected, delta)` - matches any number within proximity of expected number
- `error(msg)` - matches any error with matching error message

### Modifiers

- `not` - will make expectation fail when it should succeed and succeed when it should fail
