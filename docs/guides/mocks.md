title: Mocks
---

Mocks are dummy objects simulating behaviour of more complicated real world
objects. **Earl** supports both function and objects mocking.

## Function mocks

Imagine that we want to test simple function that transforms every single item
in an array to something else (you might be familiar with name `map`):

```typescript
function transform<T, K>(data: Array<T>, transformer: (item: T) => K) {
  const result = []

  for (const d of data) {
    result.push(transformer(d))
  }

  return result
}
```

`transform` takes an array and function `transformer` and applies `transformer`
function to every item of the input array to construct return array.

Simple enough, now let's test it! Let's create a mock transformer and pass it to
`transform`.

```typescript
import { expect, mockFn } from 'earljs'

const data = ['a', 'b']

// create a mock expecting a single string as argument and not returning anything
const mockTransformer = mockFn<[string], number>()
// setup mock behaviour BEFORE
mockTransformer.expectedCall(['a']).returns(1)
mockTransformer.expectedCall(['b']).returns(2)

const newArray = transform(data, mockTransformer)

expect(newArray).toEqual([1, 2])
// assert that all expected calls are exhausted
// this can be automated by integrating with a test runner
expect(mockTransformer).toBeExhausted()
```

Mocks are typed and a sequence of expected calls is defined upfront. Any
unexpected call will result in an error right away. Also, any expected call that
wasn't executed will make last assertion (`toBeExhausted`) fail. As you can
probably tell by now, the default way of creating mocks with **earl** is pretty
strict, that's why we call them sometimes _Strict Mocks_ (later you will learn
about _Loose Mocks_).

Let's have a little bit of fun and experiment with this. Lets try to add another
expected call like this:

```typescript
mockTransformer.expectedCall(['b']).returns(3)
```

You should see an error saying that the mock was not exhausted.

Similarly, if you would change `data` array you would get an error about
unexpected call. It's important to realize that this error is thrown right when
call happens NOT at the end of the test. This can help you write more strict
tests.

### Typing mocks

Important thing is that you **always** need to properly type your mocks. Use
`mockFn<[ARGS], RETURN>()` if you want to provide types by hand, or if you
already have a function type do:

```typescript
type StringTransformer = (something: string): string;
mockFn<StringTransformer>()
```

Due to TypeScript limitations, we cannot force you to provide these type
arguments right now, but if you forget to specify types you won't be able to use
mock as it will be turned into `never` type.

### Defining expectations

Mocks API is quite handy when it comes to describing mock behaviour and it
supports all of **earl**'s matchers.

```typescript
import { mockFn } from 'earljs'

const m = mockFn<[], number>()

// just return given value
m.expectedCall([]).returns(5)

// executes executes arbitrary function
let counter = 0
m.expectedCall([]).executes(() => counter++)

// throws an error
m.expectedCall([]).throws(() => new Error('Simulated error!'))

// simplify async mocks
const m = mockFn<[], Promise<number>>()
m.expectedCall([]).resolvesTo(5)
m.expectedCall([]).rejectsWith(new Error('Simulated error!'))

// supports matchers
const m = mockFn<[number | string], number>()

// just return given value on ANY call
m.expectedCall(expect.anything()).returns(5)

// next expect a Number
m.expectedCall([expect.a(Number)]).returns(6)
```

### Integrating with a test runner

By [integrating with a test runner](./test-runner-integration.md) you don't have
to remember to assert if mocks were exhausted by the end of the test.

### Loose Mocks

Loose mocks are alternative way to define function mocks with **earl**. They are
quote similar to Sinon's Spy or Jest's fn.

```typescript
const m = looseMockFn(() => 5)

m(1, 2, 3) // returns 5

expect(m).toHaveBeenCalledWith([1, 2, 3])
// you can assert mock.calls as well
expect(m.calls).toEqual([[1, 2, 3]])
```
