title: Step by step guide

Let's setup **mocha** with **earl** and write our first assertion. I will assume in this guide that you use TypeScript
but **earl** works with JavaScript as well.

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node mocha @types/mocha earljs
```

Note: it's `earljs` not `earl`. Also we don't have to install external typings for **earl** because it's written in
TypeScript.

## Setup TypeScript

Here's a minimal _tsconfig.json_:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["ES2018"],
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2015",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src", "test"]
}
```

## Function under tests

Lets create simple function that we are going to test:

_src/sum.ts_:

```typescript
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}
```

## Configure mocha

First, lets deal with mocha setup. Create config file in the root of the project:

_.mocharc.js_:

```js
module.exports = {
  require: [
    'ts-node/register/transpile-only', // required to run TypeScript code
  ],
  extension: ['ts'],
  watchExtensions: ['ts'],
  spec: ['test/**/*.test.ts'],
}
```

## Write our first test case

Lets create our first test suite. I like to mirror directory structure of `src/` inside my `test/` directory so that's
what we are going to do:

_test/sum.test.ts_:

```typescript
import { expect } from 'earljs'
import { sum } from '../src/sum.ts'

describe('sum', () => {
  it('sums numbers', () => {
    const actual = sum(2, 2)

    expect(actual).toEqual(4)
  })
})
```

Last thing is to create `package.json` test script:

```js
// ...
scripts: {
  "test": "mocha"
}
```

Run `npm test` and _voil√†_! You just wrote your first test case using **earl**!.

Now let's try doing something fun. Autofix is unique **earl**'s feature which helps you to write tedious assertions for
you. In our test case lets remove expected value 4 like this:

```typescript
expect(actual).toEqual()
```

and rerun tests. You should see that expected value was written automatically for us! **Earl** was able to insert
missing value during test execution. For this to happen we need source maps and that's why we enabled them in
`tsconfig.json`.

Autofix is powerful feature but remember to always manually review written values to avoid surprises. And don't worry,
autofix won't run on CI.
