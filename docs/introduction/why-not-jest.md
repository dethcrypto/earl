title: Why not jest?
---

## Motivation

I used to love mocha + chai combo, but as time flew, I felt it's limiting. Other projects like Jest shown that there is
room for innovation in this space. With last version published 2 years ago, `Chai` seems abandoned. Furthermore, as
TypeScript becomes more and more popular, it became evident that some things about writing assertions could be improved.
**earl** is an effort to bring a little bit of innovation in the space of assertion libraries.

### Why not just Jest?

I really enjoy some of the Jest's features â€” that's what inspired this library in the first place. However, I really
hate others. Jest feels too [magical](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/4414) and
[full](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2441) of [bugs](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/8688) for my
taste. On the other hand, I always enjoyed simplicity and confidence that Mocha provides.

Simply put, **Jest takes control away from you, Mocha puts you in charge**.
